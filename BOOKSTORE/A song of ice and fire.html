                <p> Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance.
                    In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. 
                    The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and 
                    supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. At the center 
                    of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land 
                    they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime 
                    kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers,
                    assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. <br>
                    Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce 
                    wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to 
                    win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of 
                    journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the 
                    fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as 
                    each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.
