        <p> Catalina Martin desperately needs a date to her sister's wedding. Especially since her
            little white lie about her American boyfriend has spiralled out of control. Now
            everyone she knows - including her ex and his fiancee - will be there and eager to 
            meet him. 
            She only has four weeks to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic and aid in her
            deception. New York to Spain is no short flight and her raucous family won't be easy 
            to fool. 
            Enter Aaron Blackford—her tall, handsome, condescending colleague—who 
            surprisingly offers to step in. She'd rather refuse; never has there been a more 
            aggravating, blood-boiling, and insufferable man.
            But Catalina is desperate, and as the wedding draws nearer, Aaron looks like her best
            option. And she begins to realize he might not be as terrible in the real world as he is
            at the office.
